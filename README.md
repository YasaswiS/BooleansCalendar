# BooleansCalendar

## Summary

With this Calendar Application, users can schedule events by designating a specific date to be notified of the event, writing a description of the event, & setting a specific time to be notified of the event. The user will be notified of the events via their smartphone or by e-mail. We may add functionality by linking it to Canvas.

## Website

###### Aditya Surapaneni

- [Link to LinkedLists Lab](https://linked-list-lab.herokuapp.com/linked-list)
- [Link to Home Page Containing All Our Labs](https://booleans-website.herokuapp.com/labs) Preferrably, click this, as it will allow you to see every member's Labs from one single area. Just hover over our names!

NOTE: The link above might take some time to load since the Sorts Lab is deployed on Heroku. 

PLS READ: Mr. M, since you are looking over all of the Labs, we would like you to re-grade our Mini Review 2. Our group got a 6/10, but you said we could improve our grade if we fixed it. We have fixed it, so please take a look at it.

Grade: 5/5

Justifications:

- I met all of the criteria outlined in the "LinkedLists Lab" assignment on Canvas.
- I built the LinkedLists Lab into the individual section of our project. Click [here](https://github.com/AdityaS1426/BooleansCalendar/blob/master/src/main/java/com/booleans/calendar/FRQ/Aditya/LinkedListsLab/LinkedList.java) to see the Java code for the LinkedList Lab.
- I linked the LinkedList Lab under my name in a dropdown menu on the Mini Labs Home Page. Click [here](https://github.com/AdityaS1426/BooleansCalendar/blob/master/src/main/resources/templates/MiniLabsHome.html#L160-L167) to see the code which controls this function.
- In my code, I allow the user to enter any number from 1 to 100 into six fields in order to create the Array. This essentially allows the user to create a Head, a Tail, as well as the parts in the middle. Furthermore, since the user can enter any number into any number of fields, they have the possibility to delete elements from the Array as well. Click [here](https://github.com/AdityaS1426/BooleansCalendar/blob/master/src/main/resources/templates/labs/Aditya/AdityaLinkedList.html#L17-L37) in order to see the code for this.
- When entered, the Array is printed out in a list, as can be seen in the code [here](https://github.com/AdityaS1426/BooleansCalendar/blob/master/src/main/resources/templates/labs/Aditya/AdityaLinkedList.html#L39-L43).
- Finally, I included time complexities in the LinkedList Lab based on the output. The code for this can be found [here](https://github.com/AdityaS1426/BooleansCalendar/blob/master/src/main/resources/templates/labs/Aditya/AdityaLinkedList.html#L45-L47).
- The Ticket I created for the LinkedList Lab can be found [here](https://github.com/AdityaS1426/BooleansCalendar/projects/1). It's at the very bottom of the "Completed" section of the Scrum Board.

###### Yasaswi Singamneni

Justifications:

- I coded all the backend aspects of linked list lab, like adding nodes to the head, and the tail end, visible [here](http://3.131.39.159/labs/Yasaswi/LinkedList).
- In my code, I allow the user to add a node of any value to the [beginning](https://github.com/AdityaS1426/BooleansCalendar/blob/master/src/main/java/com/booleans/calendar/FRQ/Yasaswi/LinkedList.java#L26) or [at the end of the linked list](https://github.com/AdityaS1426/BooleansCalendar/blob/master/src/main/java/com/booleans/calendar/FRQ/Yasaswi/LinkedList.java#L47), along with having the user ravers the linked list by following the pointers using a while loop.
- I helped my other group members in understanding and implementing linked lists, along with some members of my corssover group.
- I helped get the website running on the AWS EC2 instance.
- My linked list minilab's ticket is on our scrumboard [here](https://github.com/AdityaS1426/BooleansCalendar/projects/1).

###### Praveen Natarajan

Grade: 5/5

Justifications:

- I have successfully implemented the Insertion sort which can be seen here. [Link to Code](https://github.com/PNatarajan123/SortsLab/blob/master/src/main/java/Lab/SortInsertion.java)
- All three data types, Integer, String, POJO (toString) are compatible with my sort methods.

I got help from Aditya's lab in order to get the mappings and all of the linkings for the thyme leaf in order to deploy. I did not get any of the other sorts to successfully deploy, so I am taking off a point. In addition, Vihan and I spent 5 hours this week attempting to deploy, but it nothing worked.

Edit: We got it to deploy! Therefore, I am adding a point back to the score


###### Neil Sahai

Grade: 5/5

Justifications:

- I have successfully implemented the Insertion sort which can be seen here. [Link to Code](https://github.com/AdityaS1426/BooleansCalendar/blob/master/src/main/java/com/booleans/calendar/FRQ/Neil/InsertionSort.java)

- The link to the view is built into the individual dropdown section. [HTML Code](https://github.com/AdityaS1426/BooleansCalendar/blob/master/src/main/resources/templates/MiniLabsHome.html#L157)
- Actively built a connection to the inheritance lab into this project. Connected the food concept to the new sort code
- Working on developing a bubble sort and an selection sort. This will be up to view soon.

I spent a lot of time trying to do research on how to deploy and I spent time that was upwards of 3 hours researching AWS and deployment so I was unable to completely flesh out the inheritance lab. I hope that what I have accomplished speaks for us.

###### Yasaswi Singamneni

Grade: 5/5

###### Aditya Surapaneni

Score: 9/10

Justification:

- Most of the criteria outlined in the "Mini Review #2" assignment on MyConnect were met.
- Important criteria for each Mini Lab are outlined below.
- I did not include a WOW for the Inheritance Mini Lab & I did not get an HTML page working for the Inheritance Mini Lab, so I'm knocking a point off.

Recursion Lab

- Click [here](https://spring-boot-calculator.herokuapp.com/calculator) to access the Recursion Lab.
- The Ticket for my Recursion Mini Lab can be found under the "Completed" section [here](https://github.com/AdityaS1426/BooleansCalendar/projects/1).
- The Recursion Lab is in an individual section on the "Labs" page of the website. (Separate Dropdown Menu) Click [here](https://github.com/AdityaS1426/BooleansCalendar/blob/f628e150c165d3965c824fd1fbf878956af9e1d4/src/main/resources/templates/MiniLabsHome.html#L145) to see the code for the dropdown menu.
- I have created a calculator, which utilizes Recursion for a few of the functions, such as the Fibonacci & the Factorial.
- I have written multiple algorithms for the Factorial, including the use of [Recursion](https://github.com/AdityaS1426/BooleansCalendar/blob/master/src/main/java/com/booleans/calendar/FRQ/Aditya/RecursionLab/FactRecursion.java), [For Loops](https://github.com/AdityaS1426/BooleansCalendar/blob/master/src/main/java/com/booleans/calendar/FRQ/Aditya/RecursionLab/FactForLoop.java), [While Loops](https://github.com/AdityaS1426/BooleansCalendar/blob/master/src/main/java/com/booleans/calendar/FRQ/Aditya/RecursionLab/FactWhileLoop.java), etc. This is my WOW.
- Our team was having difficulty mapping our Recursion Lab to our existing website, so that's why my Recursion Lab is placed on a separate Heroku application. We will resolve this issue by moving to AWS in the future.

Inheritance Lab

- Due to issues with deploying to the website, I was unable to get the HTML file for my Inheritance Mini Lab working, so I created a [demonstration video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P4HzkeJpJPhy6DnHgj-SUC69sCSxHWah/view?usp=sharing). Our team will migrate to AWS to fix these issues.
- To test this Mini Lab, after cloning the repository, follow the following file path. SRC/MAIN/JAVA/COM/BOOLEANS/CALENDAR/FRQ/ADITYA/INHERITANCELAB/SHAPETESTER.JAVA.
- The Ticket for my Inheritance Mini Lab can be found under the "Completed" section [here](https://github.com/AdityaS1426/BooleansCalendar/projects/1).
- The Inheritance Lab should be in an individual section on the "Labs" page of the website, where my Recursion Lab is located, but due to issues with deployment, I couldn't get it working. A demonstration video can be found above, though. (Separate Dropdown Menu) Click [here](https://github.com/AdityaS1426/BooleansCalendar/blob/f628e150c165d3965c824fd1fbf878956af9e1d4/src/main/resources/templates/MiniLabsHome.html#L145) to see the code for the dropdown menu.

NOTE: For inputs of around 10 or less rocks, the algorithm completes so quickly that the timeelapsed function cannot register, which means it returns an output of 0 nanoseconds. (Although this is obviously not the case.)

Improvements: 
- Better Aesthetics
- Add a scaled graphic of a river and the frog crossing the river.

---------------------------------------------------------------- Week 0 & Week 1 ----------------------------

## Team SMART Goals for Mini Review #1

| Smart Goal 1 | Description |
| --- | --- |
| S | The Booleans will create a basic template for their website, with a home page set up with a background image, logo, buttons, text, etc. by March 26, 2021. Creating a template will allow for a basis to build off of while furthering the development of the intended Calendar Application. |
| M | The goal will be achieved if the Home Page successfully opens on LocalHost with the intended format. The intended background image, logo, buttons, & text should be clearly visible, & the format should be appealing. |
| A | This goal will be achieved via the use of HTML, CSS, & Java knowledge in conjunction with the IntelliJ IDEA development interface. Websites were developed in the previous Tri, so this goal is very achievable. |
| R | The goal is very realistic, especially with work put in from every team member. Most of the knowledge used to create the Home Page is from prior experience, so this goal is extremely realistic.
| T | This goal should be achieved by April 12, 2021. |

| Smart Goal 2 | Description |
| --- | --- |
| S | The Booleans will make sure their website is deployed by March 26 2021, even if the CSS formatting is not visible. The CSS formatting will be taken care of by the next checkpoint. The Booleans will utilize Heroku for deployment, as it's the simplest method. Ensuring the website is deployed is a simple goal, but it's essential for further progress, as the deployed website can be checked routinely to measure progress. |
| M | The goal will be achieved if the website is readily accessible via the public through the use of the URL. |
| A | This goal is definitely achievable, as prior experience has allowed for the knowledge necessary to easily deploy the website. |
| R | This goal is realistic, as the presence of a GitHub repository with working code is all that's necessary for deployment on Heroku. |
| T | This goal should be achieved by April 12, 2021. |

###### SMART Goal 3
| Smart Goal 3 | Description |
| --- | --- |
| S | The Booleans will start working on their Recursion Mini Lab, with the basic logic completed by March 26, 2021. If the basic logic is outlined, it will be much easier to work around the logic to establish the "view" that's part of the MVC framework. As a result, the Mini Lab will make its presence on the website at a late date, preferably by April 2, 2021. |
| M | If the recursion-based Factorial Program is able to be run successfully in IntelliJ IDEA, this goal will be achieved. |
| A | This goal will be achievable, as it's simply the basis of the Mini Lab, which will be furthered next week. |
| R | This goal is very realistic, as the Tech Talk on Thursday, March 25, 2021 provided quite a bit of insight regarding the approach necessary to complete this Mini Lab. |
| T | This goal should be achieved by April 12, 2021. |

## Individual SMART Goals

Click [here](https://github.com/AdityaS1426/BooleansCalendar/projects/1) to access the Scrum Board, which contains individual SMART Goals. They're under the "In Progress" column, with a separate card for each team member. Or, look below.

| Individual Goals | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Aditya | Contribute to the team effort by assisting in the development of the Home Page via the use of HTML & CSS. Additionally, start on the Mini Lab by creating the basic logic for the Recursion Mini Lab in Factorial.java. Finally, routinely update the README, as well as the Scrum Board, to document progress. These individual goals will be achieved if my contributions allow for the team SMART Goals to be successfully attained. These goals are achievable, as I have full access to the material necessary, such as IntelliJ IDEA, prior knowledge, team members, etc. These goals are realistic, as I have included variation to maintain focus. Focus is key in reaching the desired end result. I will make sure to complete my tasks on time so as not to let my team down. The deadline is April 12, which I am sure is enough time. |
| Yasaswi | Help integrate Java back end code and front end HTML/CSS code, and add database functionality. The goal will be acheived when you can save events in the calender/ lab results on the website. The goal is achivable, as I have expericence/old code to refer back to, from last tri's project. The goal is realistic, as I've helped on the sql databases on the last project. I will try to achieve this goal by April 12. |
| Praveen | Help Yasaswi with the database storage as well as develop the backend code that sets up all of the event listeners. This goal will be acheived when all of the buttons are able to be pressed, and when they redirect to different pages of the website. This goal is realistic because I have experience with databases from last trimester, and Yasaswi could help me out when I am stuck. I will try to attain this goal by April 12. |
| Neil | Check for APIs to allow for Canvas and Google integration so you can see your assignments, to-do's, and grades all in one space. Then implement these APIs into our project, allowing for a swift and clean connection to other apps. This goal is achievable because I have seen these kind of API integrations done into calendars before, so I can find tutorials explaining how to accomplish it if I am stuck. This goal is realistic as this is something which we can do and perserve through given our 3 tris of PBL learning. I will achieve this goal by April 12th 2021 |
| Vihan | Create another Recursion Mini-Lab with GUI, based on the problem of the frog crossing the river. This lab will be completed once the user is able to input a river of the specified width (number of stones in river), and they will receive the number of distinct paths the frog can take to get to the other side of the river. This goal is achievable because I have a solid understanding of how to create  basic recursive functions, from what has been taught in class. This goal is realistic because this problem is entry level, and not incredibly complex. I also have knowledge about how to create a basic GUI with text forms, so I will be able to create the GUI for this lab. I will achieve this goal by April 12th, 2021.
